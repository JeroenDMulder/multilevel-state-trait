This website is a supplement to "A multilevel perspective on the study of states and traits in panel data" by Mulder and Hamaker (under review). It contains *lavaan* (R) and Mplus model syntax and results for the simulations that were performed, and the four state-trait models that were discussed (in both the multilevel and structural equation modeling frameworks). These models include:

1. the common and unique trait state model (CUTS; also known as the orthogonal method factors model),
2. the indicator trait model (IT), 
3. the reference indicator model (RI; also known as the M-1 model), and
4. the correlated uniqueness model (CU).

Use the top menu to navigate to the [R code that was used for preparing the empirical data for analysis](https://jeroendmulder.github.io/multilevel-state-trait/preparation.html), [model input files](https://jeroendmulder.github.io/multilevel-state-trait/input.html), and [output](https://jeroendmulder.github.io/multilevel-state-trait/out.html).

### Data 
For the empirical example in the paper, we used 5 waves of data from the Longitudinal Internet studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel collected between 2008 and 2012, specifically responses to the Satisfaction with Life Scale by [Diener, Emmons, Larsen, and Griffin (1985)](https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327752jpa4901_13). This scale contains the following 5 items:

- `IDEA` = "In most ways my life is close to my ideal."
- `UITS` = "The conditions of my life are excellent."
- `TEVR` = "I am satisfied with my life."
- `BELA` = "So far I have gotten the important things I want in life."
- `VERA` = "If I could live my life over, I would change almost nothing."

More information about the LISS panel and the data can be obtained can be found at [https://www.lissdata.nl](https://www.lissdata.nl).
